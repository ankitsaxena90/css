				<p> CSS was first developed in 1997, as a way for Web developers to define the look and feel of their Web 					pages. It was intended to allow developers to separate content from design so that HTML could perform more 					of the function that it was originally based on - the markup of content, without worry about the design and 					layout.</p>

				<p>A CSS (cascading style sheet) file allows you to separate your web sites (X)HTML content from  style. As 					always you use your (X) HTML file to arrange the content, but all of the presentation (fonts, colors, 					background, borders, text formatting, link effects & so on. These are accomplished within a CSS.At this 				point you have some choices of how to use the CSS, either internally or externally.</p></div>
